    <h2>Welcome to django-dynamic-fields demo project !</h2>
    <p>
        Here are a number of example apps which you can test manually, or let
        robots do the work and run ./manage.py test.
    </p>
    <ul>
        {% for example in examples %}
        <li>
            <a
                href="{% url 'form' example %}"
                >{{ example|capfirst }}</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a
                href="{% url 'formset' example %}"
                >{{ example|capfirst }} formset</a>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}

        priority to fix it, and add regression test to prevent it from occuring
        again in the future. In this case, please clone the
        <a
            href="https://github.com/yourlabs/django-dynamic-fields"

        test_ddf_project and submit your pull request.
    </p>
    <p>
        The easier you make it for us to reproduce your issue in an isolated
        use-case, the best are your chances to have a satisfying answer.
