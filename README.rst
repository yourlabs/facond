This app provides features a form class dynamic, both on the client and server
side. For example if you want a field to be remove if another field has a
particular value or to filter choices based on a set conditions. The `demo
<https://ddf-yourlabs.rhcloud.com>`_ is automatically updated when a commit is
`tested
<https://travis-ci.org/yourlabs/django-dynamic-fields>`_ on master.

Pypy, Python 2.7, 3.4, Django 1.8+ are supported.

Example
=======

For example, if your form should allow support only if linux is
selected:

.. code-block:: python

    from ddf import shortcuts as ddf

    class TestForm(ddf.FormMixin, forms.Form):
        platform = forms.ChoiceField(choices=(
            ('Linux', 'Linux'),
            ('BSD', 'BSD'),
            ('Windows', 'Windows'),
        ))
        service = forms.ChoiceField(choices=(
            ('Setup', 'Setup'),
            ('Support', 'Support')
        ))

        _ddf = dict(
            # List of Actions to execute on the service field
            service=[
                # Remove the service field
                ddf.Remove(
                    # If platform field is Windows
                    ddf.ValueIs('platform', 'Windows'),
                ),
                # Remove a list of choices from the service field
                ddf.RemoveChoices(
                    ['Support'], # That's the list of choices to remove
                    # If platform field value is Windows
                    ddf.ValueIs('platform', 'BSD'),
                )
            ]
        )

This example will cause the "service" field to be removed when the user selects
platform=Windows. If the user selects BSD, then it will just remove the Support
choice from the service field.

The configuration field is able to render the configuration as a JSON dict,
with the form prefix it's being rendered with. Then, the equivalent of each
Action and Condition objects are instanciated in JavaScript, allowing dynamic
user experience.

A configuration is structured as such: for each field, you may add a list of
actions, for each action a list of conditions. When the user changes a field,
each action's conditions are evaluated and if they all pass then the action is
applied, otherwise it is unapplied. Possibilities are huge here.

Run the project
===============

Run:

    pip install --user -e git+https://github.com/yourlabs/django-dynamic-fields.git#egg=django-dynamic-fields
    cd ~/.local/src/django-dynamic-fields/src/ddf_examples
    yarn install  # sudo npm install -g yarn if necessary ;)
    yarn prepare  # or use yarn start to start webpack with --watch
    pip install --user -r requirements.txt
    ddf_examples runserver  # open localhost:8000, don't worry bout migrations ;)

Status
======

The project is pretty young, but the basic building blocks are there. We should
be able to add actions and conditions easily.

Why
===

We've been inventing this over and over again for years. The `first time I
invented this was in 2009 <https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1358/>`_ and
honnestly my python, django and javascript skills were pretty weak back then.
Since then, I've seen users asking this, paying me as a consultant for this,
making `pull requests to have this in a per-app basis
<https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light/pull/732>`_. It's about
time we have a generic solution that works for all kinds of fields, and not
just the ones of the apps we maintain.
