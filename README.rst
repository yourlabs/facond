Why
===

We've been inventing this over and over again for years. The `first time I
invented this was in 2009 <https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1358/>`_ and
honnestly my python, django and javascript skills were pretty weak back then.
Since then, I've seen users asking this, paying me as a consultant for this,
making `pull requests to have this in a per-app basis
<https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light/pull/732>`_. It's about
time we have a generic solution that works for all kinds of fields, and not
just the ones of the apps we maintain.

With lots of passion and love.
